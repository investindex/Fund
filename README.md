# Fund proposals

The behemoth asset managers we'll review in this section are BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, State Street, Schwab, and Invesco. You may choose to invest some or all of your money with these managers. However, except for straightforward cap-weighted funds, the products offered by the largest managers are not the best funds to build evidence-based portfolios.

We'll begin by discussing the limitations of funds from the largest institutions, and we'll cover specific [example portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#example-portfolios) with funds mainly from Avantis Investors and Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA). The portfolios are based on principles described in the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio). This is followed by [summary tables](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#summary) that organize selected funds from the behemoths, and suggestions for portfolios with those funds.

Finally, we cover how to navigate the limited options in an [employer's retirement plan](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#working-with-limited-options-in-your-employers-retirement-plan).

A terminology note: when used here in reference to a fund, the term _Global_ includes the US. The term _International_, abbreviated _Intl_, excludes the US.

## Beyond mainstream factor funds

The largest asset managers have been able to gradually reduce costs over time by reaching enormous scale: Vanguard's fund tracking the total US stock market hold over a trillion dollars in assets. This scale, combined with competition between fund companies, has driven management fees nearly to zero. For cap-weighted funds like [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) and [ITOT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239724/ishares-core-sp-total-us-stock-market-etf), the mainstream institutions should be everyone's first choice. However, the implementation of factor investing available from the largest institutions is suboptimal. Some people may not be comfortable straying from household names like Vanguard and Fidelity, but we can't build the best portfolios from their funds. This section will explain how we can do better.

Let's begin with Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), which was founded in 1981. Until DFA listed some of their mutual funds as ETFs in November 2020, products from DFA were accessible only to those who used certain wealth management firms and institutional retirement plans. They continue to list more as recently as May 2022, and they now offer [four bond ETFs and 19 stock ETFs](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs). DFA is renowned for thoughtful application of research findings, like risk factors, to their fund management. As described in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJMDLS6xCz8), they also have a large research team and proprietary database (read research [here](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/insights)). Ben Felix, a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenFelixCSI/videos) and [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/RATIONALREMINDER/videos) which are referenced often in the hyperlinks of this guide. He provides outstanding explanations of the value of using this knowledge in portfolio management. Due to ETFs launched in recent months, DFA now offers a suite of funds that is diverse enough to build a bespoke portfolio.

[Avantis Investors](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments.html?productLine=AVANTISEXCHANGETRADEDFUND&ext=.html) is a recently founded asset manager run by former DFA employees. Avantis provides a number of equity ETFs that [apply an understanding](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/dam/ac/pdfs/ipro/viewpoint/iuo/scientific-approach-to-investing.pdf) of the risk factors outlined in the previous section. Avantis and DFA value funds are arguably superior to mainstream factor funds because they filter _simultaneously_ for value and profitability. __It's essential to understand that this is the kind of stock selection that is motivated by an understanding of risk factors, as opposed to the crude patchwork of separate value and quality funds offered by large managers.__ The explanation for this is technical, so I've placed it in this footnote.<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> The combination of funds from these managers is an exciting development for retail investors who did not have access to funds like these before 2019.

For those who are slightly uncomfortable with how new these ETFs are, I would note that the DFA mutual fund counterparts have a much longer history: [DFSVX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/us-small-cap-value) (1993), [DISVX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/international-small-cap-value) (1994), [DFUVX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/us-large-cap-value-iii) (1995), [DFIVX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/international-value-i) (1994), and [DFEVX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/emerging-markets-value) (1998). The ETF counterparts of these mutual funds have the same ticker symbols minus the _X_. You can use [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio) to view their past performance. The ETFs will be discussed in more detail below.

Bond funds from DFA and Avantis are distinguished by using information in the current [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) to enhance returns, an approach explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toUmwo-mhjM).

Importantly, funds managed by DFA and Avantis are not index funds. They are strongly governed by quantitative rules, like index funds. But they are not required to rebalance or reconstitute during short periods like many funds managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, and others. As explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0RSFpUpovI&t=2627s) by an Avantis manager, the obligation to rebalance quickly on a pre-set schedule can create liquidity issues and lead to high trading costs. If managers have the flexibility to wait for liquidity and better prices, they are able to trade in a way that potentially produces better long-term returns. They are also able to maintain consistent exposure to factors through [daily implementation](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/DailyImplementation.pdf) (also known as active implementation). This means they have the freedom to slightly adjust the portfolio every day with updated information, rather than waiting to rebalance on a quarterly or semi-annual schedule as factor exposure diminishes. To be fair to the large managers like Vanguard, some of their funds such as VTRIX [do use active implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH1pJwRn-gQ&t=1492s). The investment strategies of funds from Avantis and DFA often can't be summarized in a simple title, so be sure to read the prospectus in order to understand the fund's strategies. You should always do this anyway, but it is especially important when the fund manager has significant flexibility. In particular, even their funds with neutral names like "US equity" have factor tilts, so [AVUS](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-equity-etf.html) and [DFAC](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfac/us-core-equity-2-etf) are not counterparts of [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti).

Alpha Architect is a smaller manager that develops [focused factor ETFs](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com). They create concentrated portfolios (with about 50 stocks in each fund) based on quantitative rules that seek to maximize the higher expected returns of factors like value. If you want to make an especially strong bet on value, probably with a small fraction of your portfolio, using ETFs like [QVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/qval/) and [IVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/ival/) is a way to do it. Alpha Architect uses somewhat different measures of value than Avantis and DFA do, so allocating to their funds is a way to diversify implementation. (DFA and Avantis products also differ from one another, to a lesser degree.) [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kldNkfPBCBk) is a great explanation of Alpha Architect's ideas by its founder, Wes Gray. They also publish highly relevant [research on their website](https://alphaarchitect.com/blog/). BlackRock does have one product like this ([FOVL](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/307330/ishares-focused-value-factor-etf)), although it appears to lack the strong filter for profitability that makes Alpha Architect products attractive. Alpha Architect also has momentum ETFs, if you're interested in going down [that rab](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/07/momentum-everywhere-including-in-factors/)[bit hole](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Fact-Fiction-and-Momentum-Investing) and potentially allocating a small fraction of your portfolio to QMOM and IMOM.

## Example portfolios

These simplified examples are for a hypothetical person, age 35 and earning income, who rents their residence and has no debt. Their liquid net worth is $40,000 plus $60,000 in a Roth IRA that they have contributed to for several years. Some funds are duplicated because their taxable brokerage account and Roth IRA are separate accounts.

Couch potato portfolio A uses a very simple factor-tilted portfolio: 60% [DFAC](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfac/us-core-equity-2-etf) + 40% [DFAX](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfax/world-ex-us-core-equity-2-etf). If someone wanted to add just one more fund, the greatest marginal benefit would probably lie in a high-quality, long-duration bond fund: 45% [DFAC](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfac/us-core-equity-2-etf) + 30% [DFAX](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfax/world-ex-us-core-equity-2-etf) + 25% [GOVZ](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/315911/). DFAC was selected over the other two broad US equity funds offered by Dimensional because DFAC is the most factor-tilted. DFAC could be replaced with [AVUS](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-equity-etf.html) from Avantis, but AVUS is also less factor-tilted than DFAC.

The long-term complex allocation is:
* 20% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) — Global cap-weighted stocks
* 21% [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) — US small cap value stocks
* 14% [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html) — US large cap value stocks
* 10.5% [AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html) — Developed ex-US small cap value stocks
* 7% [AVIV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-large-cap-value-etf.html) — Developed ex-US large cap value stocks
* 7.5% [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html) — Emerging value stocks
* 20% [GOVZ](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/315911/) — Long-duration US Treasury bonds

Portfolio suggestions should be personalized, but if I were to make a recommendation for a disciplined investor's long-term portfolio, it would be something like this. AVUV could potentially be replaced (or combined) with [DFSV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfsv/us-small-cap-value-etf); AVLV with [DFUV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfuv/us-marketwide-value-etf); AVDV with [DISV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf); AVIV with [DFIV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfiv/international-value-etf); and AVES with [DFEV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfev/emerging-markets-value-etf). Some people would be well-advised to adjust the allocation to VT upward; few people are suited to a portfolio with less allocation to VT and a stronger value tilt. An alternative would be to increase VT to 40% and dial down the other stock funds.

A simplified version is in the couch potato portfolio B: 50% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) + 30% [DFSV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfsv/us-small-cap-value-etf) + 20% [DISV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf). The diversification is [not as robust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJMDLS6xCz8&t=4979s), but those who seek simplicity can achieve excellent geographic and risk factor diversification with only three funds.

The stocks in the complex portfolio have a geographic allocation that is close to global market cap weights. Value is highly overweighted, and small cap value even more so. However, we include nearly all global stocks to some degree by using VT as the core. We add long-term US Treasury [STRIPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurystrips.asp) for bonds with minimal credit risk and maximum interest rate risk. (See [here](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#understanding-bonds-and-their-risks) for explanation of these risks.) There are three potential ETFs for this role: [EDV](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/edv), [GOVZ](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/315911/), and [ZROZ](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/25-year-zero-coupon-us-treasury-index-exchange-traded-fund/). Although EDV has the lowest expense ratio, GOVZ and ZROZ have a slightly higher effective [duration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp) (i.e., they are more sensitive to interest rates). Between the latter two, GOVZ wins due to a low share price, which facilitates investing a more precise amount in a small account. I also chose [SCHB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schb) over [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) simply because SCHB has a much lower share price. See the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#the-tax-issue-with-global-funds) for the minor tax incentive to split VT into total US (SCHB) and total international (VXUS) funds in taxable accounts (but _not_ in tax-advantaged accounts).

Potential additions to these portfolios, including [QVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/qval/) and [IVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/ival/), are discussed in the [advanced topics](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced#real-estate-investment-trusts-reits). A reader might wonder why some of the portfolios from large asset managers below have mid cap funds, while the complex portfolio here does not. Avantis and DFA don't use a mid cap categorization: their small cap and large cap funds cover the entire range of market capitalizations. So nothing is missing. However, if you wanted to add more weight to mid cap stocks, you could add [RFV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RFV) to the complex portfolio. RFV diversifies implementation and has very little [overlap](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php) with AVUV, AVLV, and QVAL.

## Summary

These tables summarize stock and bond funds from the largest institutions.

The term "quality" is used for certain factor funds. Quality, in its most rigorous definition, arguably ought to [refer](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/content/dam/ra/documents/faj-second-quarter-2019-what-is-quality.pdf) to the profitability and investment factors. However, it is mainly a [marketing term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsWgWrpzdAM&t=1143s) for funds that select stocks based on a variety of "healthy balance sheet" indicators. Strategies under the quality label can differ substantially. Some are better than others at efficiently targeting the profitability and investment factors, which are the variables that systematically account for differences in risk and return.

&nbsp;

Some of the Vanguard bond ETFs have a mutual fund counterpart with a purchase fee, which disincentivizes rapid trading. Those mutual funds are excluded, so none of the funds in the table have a purchase fee. Other Vanguard bond ETFs lack a mutual fund counterpart.

In addition to [SPHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPHQ), Invesco manages US mid cap ([XMHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XMHQ)) and small cap ([XSHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XSHQ)) quality funds.

There are also the [target maturity date bond funds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#bond-like-bond-funds), the all-in-one funds [discussed in the guidelines](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#simplify-your-investments-dont-simplify-your-thinking), and the additional funds discussed below and in the [first footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#f1).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## ETFs (largest managers)

The ETF issuers with the largest total [assets under management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (in decreasing order). The [ETF database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/issuers/#issuer-power-rankings__aum&sort_name=revenue_position&sort_order=asc&page=1) and [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/sections/etf-league-tables.html) are great resources for comparing and searching for ETFs.

## Mutual funds (largest managers)

The leading providers of passive mutual funds are Fidelity and Vanguard; Schwab has a smaller collection but also covers some indices which the first two do not (see RAFI indices in the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio)). Mutual fund offerings are not as diverse, so even the complex portfolio is not as complex as the ETF version.

### General comments

Although the funds are presented as groups, there is no prize for brand loyalty and you may want to choose a combination of managing institutions, as well as a combination of ETFs and mutual funds. Keep in mind that investing in mutual funds from more than one manager often requires using multiple accounts or paying fees; this is a major advantage of ETFs.

Some of these portfolios, like the simple and complex ETF portfolios, are highly factor-tilted. Investors who are concerned with not diverging too far from standard market returns should include a significant allocation to a total market fund or large cap fund (which are very similar because the cap-weighted total market is dominated by large cap stocks). Examples of US large cap funds are in the summary table. They could also hold [RAFI funds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g), which are value-tilted but not as strongly as a value fund because they hold growth stocks as well (while underweighting them). RAFI funds are offered by Schwab and Invesco, among others.

## Working with limited options in your employer's retirement plan

Investing in a taxable account or an IRA permits you to choose among a very broad selection of options. You can build whatever custom portfolio of ETFs you like. But within some accounts — mainly 529 accounts and employer-sponsored retirement accounts like the 401(k) — your options may be highly restricted. Usually there is no access to ETFs in these accounts, and the list of available mutual funds can be very small. Moreover, fees that investors no longer have to tolerate in a taxable account or an IRA are [still common](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp) in work retirement plans. In addition to account fees, the expense ratios on available funds can range from normal to outrageously high. Account fees can be a flat charge if you're lucky — like $15 each quarter — or calculated as a percentage of assets in your account.

Even if you have access to (say) a total stock market fund with an expense ratio of eight basis points, an asset-based fee of 60 basis points would mean that you're paying a total of .68% in fees every year. As emphasized in the [section on retirement](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement), even half a percentage point's difference in average returns is an enormous difference if compounded over many years. You can roll over money in your employer plan to your IRA, but this is usually not permitted until you’ve left your employer. This creates a perverse incentive against staying with the same employer for a long time, especially if their retirement plan is poor. All else equal, it is advantageous to change employers and liberate your money from a restrictive and high-fee employer plan. Some of the largest 401(k) plan providers are Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Prudential, and T. Rowe Price. TIAA is the largest plan provider for 403(b) accounts, which are for nonprofits.

We've [briefly discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Index#common-indices) that a company's stock can have multiple share classes with different voting rights. Much more relevant is that funds can also have multiple share classes. Share classes of a fund invest in the same portfolio but can have different minimum investments, expense ratios, and other fees. Each share class has its own ticker.

Take the largest fund in the world: Vanguard's [total US stock fund](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0970). Its oldest share class with the lowest initial minimum investment is the Investor class ([VTSMX](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0085)), with an expense ratio of .14%. Vanguard's Investor shares have been phased out and are no longer open to new investors. Admiral shares ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtsax)) have a lower expense ratio of .04% and an initial minimum of $3,000. Institutional shares ([VITSX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vitsx)) have an expense ratio of .03% and an initial minimum of $5 million. A retirement plan administrator can reach this minimum by pooling the contributions of many plan participants; individual employees don't need to have that much on their own. Institutional Plus shares ([VSMPX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vsmpx)) have an expense ratio of .02% and an initial minimum of $100 million. And only for the largest institutions, Institutional Select shares ([VSTSX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vstsx)) have an expense ratio of .01% and an initial minimum of $5 billion. All of these share classes are mutual funds: there is also an ETF share class ([VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vti)) with an expense ratio of .03%.

These are Vanguard's names for their share classes. Other fund companies have share classes with different names and properties. To gather information about each fund offered to you in your retirement plan, read the fund's [prospectus](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/mutual-fund-prospectus). The two sections you should check are “principal investment strategies” and “fees and expenses”. For index funds, the primary fact you need from "principal investment strategies" is what index the fund tracks. If it’s an active fund, this section will give a broad overview of the fund’s approach. Some retirement plans offer active funds with egregious expense ratios above 1%. As I explained above, active funds aren’t always bad: those from Avantis, DFA, and a few others are systematic and have relatively low expense ratios. There are several potential fees you should be aware of. Some of them are found in the “fees and expenses” section of the prospectus, and some can be imposed by your plan provider.

* Expense ratio: the annual fees extracted from the fund to cover various operating expenses.

* Redemption fees: a fee charged due to selling shares, especially if you hold shares less than a defined period. Both your plan administrator and the fund can potentially charge redemption fees.

* Loads: a front-end load is a one-time fee charged when buying shares, and a back-end load when redeeming shares. They’re calculated as a percentage of your investment. A back-end load is a type of redemption fee.

* Purchase fees: these fees are paid directly to the fund to offset trading costs, and as an incentive against rapid trading. Even some Vanguard mutual funds have this fee, like [VBLAX](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/2022). They’re also calculated as a percentage of your investment.

* Transaction fees: some funds may have transaction fees imposed by your plan administrator, not the fund itself.

See [this explanation](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/mutual-fund-fees-and-expenses) for more details on the types of fees a mutual fund can charge. Loads, redemption fees, purchase fees, and others are collectively referred to as “shareholder fees”. ETFs do not charge shareholder fees, which is another one of their advantages. In your retirement plan, ideally you can choose funds with low expense ratios, no redemption fees, no loads, no purchase fees, and no transaction fees. There may be short-term redemption fees that you can avoid by holding shares for a sufficient length of time. FINRA has a [fund analyzer](https://tools.finra.org/fund_analyzer/) that makes it easy to [compare](https://www.finra.org/investors/tools-and-calculators/using-finra-fund-analyzer) the fees you'll pay by investing in different funds.

Check your plan’s commission and fee schedule for their policies on transaction fees, commissions, and short-term redemption fees. If their policies are unclear, feel free to call them. Ensure that you know about all investment options in your plan. There may be more self-directed options beyond the core offerings.

In some retirement plans, the options are so limited that choosing your portfolio is relatively easy. This is, of course, a hindrance as well: your plan may offer aggregate bond funds but not long-duration bond funds. It may not offer value funds and, if it does, it probably doesn't offer those with the implementation suggested above. Some plans don't even offer access to international stocks! You may find yourself needing to counterbalance underweighted markets in your retirement plan by overweighting those markets in other accounts. If your retirement plan doesn’t offer low-cost access to international stocks, you can calculate the dollar amount that _would_ be invested in international stocks, and overweight them by that amount in your IRA, HSA, and taxable account. Counterbalancing between accounts can become impossible to do accurately if you work at the same place for a long time and your employer plan becomes much larger than your other accounts. In that case, you just have to do your best.

If you can't directly build the portfolio you want, you may be able to piece it together from multiple funds. This may require looking up the indices tracked by the funds in your plan, and figuring out whether they're similar to other funds that you're familiar with. You might want part of your portfolio to be a total US stock fund. Perhaps that isn't offered, but let's say there's an [S&P 500 fund](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0540) and an [extended market fund](https://institutional.vanguard.com/investments/product-details/fund/0598) (which is a total US market fund minus the S&P 500). You can use a [fund overlap](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php) calculator to find that the overlap of a total US market fund (VTI) and an S&P 500 fund (VOO) is about 84%, which means that you can replicate a total US market portfolio with an allocation of about 84% to the S&P 500 and 16% to the extended market.

If your plan has no other low-cost options, you may want to settle for a target retirement fund.

#### HSA investing

Unfortunately, the obstructions don't always end with retirement plans. If your employer offers an HSA-eligible health plan and you choose to enroll, they will likely deposit HSA contributions with only one HSA administrator of their choice. Many HSA administrators have limited investment options, fees, or requirements to keep a certain amount in cash. But in contrast to retirement plans, you're not stuck with your employer's choice. You can transfer the money to a different account. If you plan to invest in your HSA, I recommend using Fidelity: you'll have as much freedom as you do in an IRA, and you won't be charged fees. (Schwab currently doesn't offer an HSA.) You may be lucky enough to have an employer who already uses Fidelity, or another great HSA provider like Lively, in which case you wouldn't need to open a second HSA.

You can't transfer money to your Fidelity HSA after every paycheck, because there are only two ways to transfer. The first is an account transfer, which can be done any number of times but usually costs at least $20. The second is to [transfer the money yourself](https://thefinancebuff.com/how-to-rollover-an-hsa-on-your-own-and-avoid-trustee-transfer-fee.html) for free, but you can do this only once per rolling year. So I suggest the following: (1) Contribute nothing or very little to your HSA for most of the year, to keep cash from sitting idle in your employer-sponsored HSA; (2) sharply increase your contributions near the end of the year, while ensuring that you leave enough for health insurance premiums, retirement contributions, and any other payroll deductions. Plan how many paychecks you'll need to reach the annual maximum (or whatever your intended contribution is). (3) After the year's last paycheck, transfer the money to your Fidelity HSA.

As we'll discuss [later](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#contribution-timing), it's okay if you somehow don't finish contributions by the end of the calendar year. HSA contributions can be delayed until tax day of the following year (roughly April 15). The same applies to your IRA, but work retirement contributions have a cutoff at the end of the calendar year.

#### Questions for a potential employer

Before accepting a job, you should inquire about the benefits offered. Health insurance, HSAs, and retirement plans have financial consequences that many people don't consider until after they've accepted a position. Differences in benefits can be as important as salary differences. You should find out:

* What is the employer retirement contribution policy?

* What is the vesting schedule of employer retirement contributions?

* What investment options are offered by the retirement plan?

* What are the fees of the retirement plan?

* Do they offer an HSA-eligible health plan? How much would your insurance premiums, deductible, and out-of-pocket max be?

* What HSA administrator do they use? What are their fees, investment options, and other policies?

* Info on other benefits like vacation days, [employee ownership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/esop.asp), other types of group insurance such as life insurance, etc.

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> <b> Additional funds and minor comments </b>

The following details are not particularly important except for those people who want to know all their options. This is an info dump.

There are a bunch of options for cap-weighted US funds. Are there any differences between them? Some of their differences can be shown by ranking them by number of holdings: [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) > [FSKAX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911693) > [ITOT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239724/ishares-core-sp-total-us-stock-market-etf) > [SWTSX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swtsx) > [SCHB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schb) > [SPTM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-sp-1500-composite-stock-market-etf-sptm) > [PBUS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBUS). VTI is a comprehensive index of the US market, whereas PBUS is effectively a large cap fund (which is why I placed it in that row). SPTM is distinctive, being composed of 1,500 stocks: the S&P 500 (large cap), S&P 400 (mid cap), and S&P 600 (small cap). Not only does this place an artificial cap on the number of stocks included in the fund, but S&P indices exclude unprofitable companies. This had a meaningful effect in 2020, when the price of [Tesla stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA) increased by 743%. This run-up was captured by true total market funds like VTI and ITOT, as well as broad large cap funds like VV and SCHX, but not by SPTM or S&P 500 index funds ([VOO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo), [IVV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/ishares-core-sp-500-etf), [SPY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy)). Tesla wasn't added to the S&P 500 until the end of 2020, after four consecutive quarters of profitable operation. VTI returned 21.05% that year, while SPTM returned 17.87%.

Some people may wonder about the omission of Fidelity's zero-fee mutual funds, which include the total US fund [FZROX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T708) and total international fund [FZILX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T609). You can check their holdings, which are far less numerous than the holdings of their counterparts [FSKAX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911693) and [FTIHX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635V638). The zero-fee funds are discount products, holding a less comprehensive cross-section of the market. Given that Fidelity index funds already have the lowest fees in the business, the drop to zero fees is not all that advantageous. I would personally choose FSKAX and FTIHX, but it doesn't much matter except in one respect. If you want to transfer your account to another broker, you can transfer most mutual funds, but you cannot transfer these zero-fee mutual funds. You have to sell your shares for that money to escape a Fidelity account.

In general, Vanguard uses the most exhaustive indices, providing the best representation of the target market. They even supported the creation of the CRSP indices at the University of Chicago; see [this WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mutual-funds-that-ate-wall-st-11638390382) on the "fund that ate Wall Street". However, I don't want to exaggerate the importantance of picking the right total US fund: in the long run, they will have highly similar returns.

&nbsp;

Bond funds that did not fit in the summary table are: BlackRock's US and international high-yield bond fund ([GHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239551/ishares-global-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf)); and funds from Avantis and DFA: their aggregate US bond funds ([AVIG](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-core-fixed-income-etf.html) / [DFCF](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfcf/core-fixed-income-etf)), short-term US bond funds ([AVSF](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-short-term-fixed-income-etf.html) / [DFSD](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfsd/short-duration-fixed-income-etf)), and municipal bond funds ([AVMU](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-core-municipal-fixed-income-etf.html) / [DFNM](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfnm/national-municipal-bond-etf)). Municipal bonds are suitable for those in high tax brackets because of their tax advantages (also see [VTEB](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vteb) / [MUB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239766/ishares-national-amtfree-muni-bond-etf) / [FMBIX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T765)).

There are also bond funds in categories not yet discussed. These include mortgage-backed securities, which are included in the aggregate funds like BND ([VMBS](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vmbs) / [MBB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239465/ishares-mbs-etf) / [CMBS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239459/ishares-cmbs-etf) / [SPMB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-mortgage-backed-bond-etf-spmb)); treasury inflation-protected securities ([TIPS](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/introduction-treasury-inflation-protected-securities-tips/)), which can manage inflation risk ([DFIP](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfip/inflation-protected-securities-etf) / [FIPDX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T104) / [VTIP](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vtip) / [VIPSX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vipsx) / [STIP](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239450/ishares-05-year-tips-bond-etf) / [TIP](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239467/ishares-tips-bond-etf) / [SPIP](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-tips-etf-spip) / [SCHP](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schp) / [PBTP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBTP)); [floating-rate bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frn.asp) with adjustable coupon rates ([TFLO](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/260652/ishares-treasury-floating-rate-bond-etf) / [FLRN](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-investment-grade-floating-rate-etf-flrn) / [FLTR](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/investment-grade-floating-rate-etf-fltr/)); developed markets ex-US treasury bonds without currency hedging ([IGOV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239830/ishares-international-treasury-bond-etf) / [BWX](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-international-treasury-bond-etf-bwx)); and emerging markets treasury bonds denominated in USD ([VWOB](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwob) / [EMB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239572/ishares-jp-morgan-usd-emerging-markets-bond-etf) / [PCY](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PCY)) or in local currencies ([EBND](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-emerging-markets-local-bond-etf-ebnd)).

&nbsp;

Invesco offers many products not available from the behemoths. One category is their equal-weighted funds. They have an equal-weighted small cap fund with the S&P 600 ([EWSC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWSC)), an equal-weighted mid cap fund with the S&P 400 ([EWMC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWMC)), and an equal-weighted large cap fund with the S&P 500 ([RSP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RSP)). They also have an equal-weighted Russell 1000 fund ([EQAL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EQAL)), but unlike the other funds it weights equally within sectors, not overall. As Rob Arnott discusses [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g), equal weighting is one way to break the link between a stock's price (i.e., market cap) and its weighting within a fund. (The darts he refers to in the video are not an obscure acronym. They are [actual darts](https://thereformedbroker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jpm_summer2013_rallc.pdf), meaning random selection of equally weighted stocks. Burton Malkiel's 1973 book _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ first referred to “a blindfolded monkey throwing darts”.) BlackRock has an equal-weighted fund with mid and large cap US stocks ([EUSA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239693/ishares-msci-usa-etf)).

Invesco offers small ([RZV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RZV)), mid ([RFV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RFV)), and large ([RPV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RPV)) cap US funds with very strong value tilts. Another fund ([SPVU](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPVU)) holds the 100 stocks with the strongest value characteristics in the S&P 500. They also manage three US quality funds ([SPHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPHQ) / [XMHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XMHQ) / [XSHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XSHQ)) and a developed ex-US quality fund ([IDHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IDHQ)).

Invesco has a number of RAFI funds: total US ([IUS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IUS)), US small company ([IUSS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IUSS)), US large company ([PRF](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PRF)), US small and mid company ([PRFZ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PRFZ)), developed ex-US ([ISDX](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=ISDX)/[PXF](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PXF)), developed ex-US small and mid company ([PDN](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PDN)), and emerging markets ([ISEM](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=ISEM)/[PXH](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PXH)).

Some Schwab funds don't fit neatly into the summary table: their RAFI total US ETF ([FNDB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndb)), RAFI US large company funds ([FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)/[SFLNX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sflnx)), and RAFI emerging markets funds ([FNDE](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fnde)/[SFENX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sfenx)). In addition to the Schwab 1000 mutual fund included in the table ([SNXFX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/snxfx)), there is a Schwab 1000 ETF ([SCHK](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schk)). These funds hold the 1000 largest US companies, whereas Schwab's large cap ETF holds the 750 largest US companies ([SCHX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schx)). The differences between SCHK and SCHX are negligible.

&nbsp;

When deciding on weights for developed vs. emerging markets, keep in mind that all the international single-factor funds that don't have "emerging" in their name invest exclusively in developed countries, except VTRIX.

There are two ETFs for small cap stocks in emerging markets, [EEMS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239642/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-smallcap-etf) and [EWX](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-emerging-markets-small-cap-etf-ewx). Without a filter for value or profitability, their high expense ratios suggest that these funds are not worth including at this time. The DFA emerging markets small cap fund [DEMSX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/emerging-markets-small-cap) has had great historical returns and benefits from the factor exposure of all DFA funds, but it is not publicly accessible. Some would point out that [DGS](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/equity/dgs), a small cap dividend ETF for emerging markets, provides some indirect exposure to value and profitability factors due to the dividend focus.

BlackRock has an alternative to IUSV. This fund, [VLUE](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf), has a smaller number of holdings and a stronger value tilt than IUSV. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> <b> Understanding risk factors and why they don't travel alone </b>

Before reading this, I recommend listening to Ben Felix’s explanation on [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdREnI5ytc&t=1096s) and in [this brief written post](https://rationalreminder.ca/blog/2019/8/22/zqes51gt9xfgi7iggxtjfmuh8z73sf). Hearing it first (from roughly the 18 min to 28 min marks) may help with processing this dense material.

A few concepts must be established to understand why simultaneous implementation of factors is so much more effective than implementation of single factors in separate funds.

The first is that there is information in prices. When people trade a stock — one investor buys and another sells, at a particular price they agree on — they bring their views to the trade about what a fair price is. Most of the dollars involved in trading are from institutional investors.

The next concept is that financial markets are [efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c), which means that prices reflect available information and quickly adapt to new information. The strongest evidence that markets are highly efficient is that [very few](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) active managers outperform their benchmark in the long run. The efficiency of the market implies that the information in prices is useful. Markets don’t need to be perfectly efficient — settling upon fair prices for all stocks at every moment — for this information to be valuable.

In particular, we can derive information that is implied about the risk of a stock’s returns. To do so we need to understand _discount rates_, and how we value the ownership provided by shares of a stock. Fractional ownership provides an investor with rights to the company’s assets and future profits. The expected future profits for any company are subject to risk. Investors should be willing to pay less for riskier future profits, and more for safer future profits.

This is where the discount rate comes in: we value future profits less if they are riskier, so we discount them more. In other words, riskier future profits have a higher discount rate applied to them. They also have a higher expected return. This makes sense from the investors’ perspective: in order to be compensated for accepting a higher risk that a given stream of future profits will not materialize, investors must be provided with a higher expected return by paying less for those potential profits. In fact, the discount rate is equivalent to the expected return, because the return generated if the expected profits materialize is equal to the difference between the profits and the discounted price we paid for them. This is much easier to understand for bonds than for stocks, because bonds have a known cash flow and a maturity date.

One more term is needed before we move to the final stage: [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/book-value-basics.asp). Simply put, book value describes the assets minus liabilities of a company. It is the most common fundamental measure of a company used to describe relative price: price-to-book (P/B). Stocks with lower prices relative to book value are value stocks; those with higher prices relative to book value are growth stocks.

We’ve established that in an efficient market, stock prices reflect the present value of future profits, discounted at a discount rate which is equal to the expected rate of return. How does this relate to risk factors? Ben Felix discussed a valuation model called the dividend discount model in [this post](https://rationalreminder.ca/blog/2019/8/22/zqes51gt9xfgi7iggxtjfmuh8z73sf). Fully understanding the equation is not really needed to grasp the point of this long chain of conceptual development. What are the core lessons we can draw from it?

The equation describes relationships between a number of variables, including the company's book value, the company's earnings, the stock's market price, and the discount rate/expected return (which are identical). If we hold everything constant except the price and the expected return, what happens when we lower the price? A stock with a lower price than another, all else equal, must have a higher expected return. Why is this? Because we are paying a lower price for the same future profits. In other words, because we assume that the market prices of both stocks are fair, the prices imply that the stock with a lower price is riskier. This is an expression of the value premium, within the equation! The value premium is the empirical finding that stocks with lower prices relative to their book value tend to produce higher returns than those with higher relative prices.

Can we find expressions of the other premiums in this equation? If we hold everything constant except the company's expected future earnings and the expected return, what happens when we increase future earnings? A stock with higher future earnings than another, all else equal, must have higher expected return. The market is observing a stock with higher future earnings than another, and assigning the same price to both. This implies that the market is pricing in higher risk to the stock with higher future earnings. To be clear: the profitability of the first stock is higher, but the price implies that the profits are perceived as riskier. Thus, the counterintuitive statement that stocks with higher profitability are riskier (and have higher expected return) — the profitability premium.

The same follows with the investment premium: all else equal, stocks with more conservative investment in company assets — in jargon, lower expected changes in book equity — must have a higher expected return.

So there is an insight in this equation: the market price implies a certain discount rate, which we can use to understand the risk and expected return of the stock. We can understand the premiums provided by lower relative price, higher profitability, and more conservative investment from a theoretical perspective. And once we do that, we see the crucial phrase I used repeatedly: all else equal. Ceteris paribus! This is essential because it means that attempting to achieve higher returns by selecting for stocks with low relative prices, or high profitability, or conservative investment is less effective than selecting for stocks with all of those characteristics simultaneously. Filtering for stocks with, say, low relative price without attending to the other factors is not what an understanding of risk factors actually suggests.

This has led to a proliferation of multifactor funds. Unfortunately, I currently have no basis to believe that any of them will achieve consistently high exposure to the academic risk factors. Many institutions are not as concerned with rigorously capturing risk premiums as they are with marketing funds supposedly based on fashionable academic research. The Avantis and DFA value funds, which filter for profitability as well as low relative price, are my main recommendations for factor tilts. One example of a specific portfolio using these funds is provided above (the complex portfolio). (I am not implying that funds like RZV and IJS provide no benefit — certainly they provide some exposure to value and profitability, especially RZV.) I haven't thoroughly studied all multifactor funds, so for anyone with interest I've listed many of them in the footnote below.<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup> In general, a multifactor fund should describe how they intend to capture the risk premiums associated with value and profitability. Investment is harder to implement because the effect is [primarily driven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj-RO4mh-wA&t=2161s) by small cap stocks with low profitability. This information would be in their prospectus under "principal investment strategies". The Avantis value funds straightforwardly describe their method of capturing the profitability and value premiums.

In addition, the [factor regression tool](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/factor-analysis) provided by Portfolio Visualizer shows that Avantis funds like AVUV have high exposure to the value and profitability factors, while the multifactor funds below do not. Be aware that the tool is valid only for funds that invest in US stocks. [↩](#fn2)
