# Fund proposals

For ETFs and mutual funds separately, I will propose portfolios with increasing levels of complexity and provide options from multiple institutions. The portfolios are based on principles described in the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio). If an institution lacks a fund to fill a given row's category, it will either be left blank or filled in with a suggested fund from another institution. The simplest portfolios are a single fund: a total global fund or a total US fund. [Summary tables](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#summary) at the end organize all the funds. I then discuss the limitations of the stock funds from the largest institutions, and show how we can improve upon them with an [example portfolio](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#example-portfolio) of specific stock and bond funds.

A terminology note: when used here in reference to a fund, the term _Global_ includes the US. The term _International_, abbreviated _Intl_, excludes the US.

&nbsp;

## ETFs

The ETF issuers with the largest total [assets under management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) are BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (in decreasing order). The [ETF database](https://etfdb.com/etfs/issuers/#issuer-power-rankings__aum&sort_name=revenue_position&sort_order=asc&page=1) and [ETF.com](https://www.etf.com/channels/) are great resources for comparing and searching for ETFs. Regardless of your choice, the fees are a matter of cents annually for every $100 invested.

## Mutual funds

The leading providers of indexed mutual funds are Fidelity and Vanguard; Schwab has a smaller collection but also covers some indices which the first two do not (see RAFI indices in the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio)). Mutual fund offerings are not as diverse, so even the complex portfolio is not as complex as the ETF version. As with ETFs, annual fees are pennies per year for every $100 invested.

## General comments

Although the funds are presented as groups, there is no prize for brand loyalty and you may want to choose a combination of managing institutions, as well as a combination of ETFs and mutual funds. Keep in mind that investing in mutual funds from more than one manager requires using multiple accounts or paying fees; this is a major advantage of ETFs.

Some of these portfolios, like the simple and complex ETF portfolios, are highly factor-tilted. Investors who are concerned with not diverging too far from standard market returns should include a significant allocation to a total market fund or large cap fund (which are very similar because the cap-weighted total market is dominated by large cap stocks). Examples of US large cap funds are in the summary table. They could also hold [RAFI funds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), which are value-tilted but not as strongly as a value fund because they hold growth stocks as well (while underweighting them). RAFI funds are offered by Schwab and Invesco, among others.

See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> for additional funds, including RAFI funds, and the discussion below for other approaches to achieving factor tilts. My preferred approach is exhibited in the example portfolio section, and it's substantively different than the portfolios above.

## Beyond mainstream factor funds

It's important to stress that the implementation of factor investing available from the largest institutions is suboptimal. Some people may not be comfortable straying from household names like Vanguard and Fidelity, but we can't build the best portfolios from their funds. This section will explain how we can do better.

Let's begin with Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), which was founded in 1981. Products from DFA were accessible only to those who used wealth management firms for about 40 years, until they finally decided to list some of their mutual funds as ETFs in November 2020. They continue to list more as recently as September 2021, and they now offer [nine ETFs](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs). DFA is renowned for applying the discoveries of scientific research, such as risk factors, to their fund management. Ben Felix, a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenFelixCSI/videos) and [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/RATIONALREMINDER/videos) which are referenced often in the hyperlinks of this guide. He provides outstanding explanations of the value of using this knowledge in portfolio management. I don't find much use for the ETFs that DFA has listed so far, but that will change as they list more.

Why is this relevant? Avantis Investors is a recently founded asset manager run by former DFA employees. [Their funds](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments.html) are also of the highest quality, and for now they offer a more useful suite of publicly accessible funds (ETFs). Avantis provides a number of equity ETFs that are unrivaled in their application of our understanding of risk factors. Avantis value funds are arguably superior because they filter simultaneously for value and profitability. It's essential to understand that this is the kind of stock selection that is motivated by an understanding of risk factors, as opposed to the crude patchwork of separate value and quality funds suggested above. The explanation for this is somewhat technical, so I've placed it in this footnote.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> Given the unique access to high-quality factor investing that Avantis funds provide to retail investors, my favored portfolio in the example section (complex portfolio A) is mostly composed of Avantis funds.

Like those from DFA, bond funds from Avantis are distinguished by using information in the current [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) to enhance returns, an approach explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toUmwo-mhjM&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast).

Importantly, funds managed by DFA and Avantis are not index funds. They are strongly governed by quantitative rules, like index funds, but are not required to rebalance or reconstitute during short periods like many index funds managed by Vanguard or BlackRock. As explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0RSFpUpovI&t=2627s&ab_channel=StrategicAnalysisCapitalManagement) by an Avantis manager, the obligation to rebalance quickly on a pre-set schedule can create liquidity issues and lead to high trading costs. If managers have the flexibility to wait for liquidity and better prices, they are able to trade in a way that potentially produces better long-term returns. Their investment strategies can't always be summarized in a simple title, so be sure to read the prospectus to fully understand the fund's strategies. You should always do this anyway, but it is especially important when the fund manager has significant flexibility. In particular, even their funds with neutral names like "US equity" have factor tilts, so AVUS is not a counterpart of VTI.

Alpha Architect is a smaller manager that develops [focused factor ETFs](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com). They create concentrated portfolios (with about 50 stocks in each fund) based on quantitative rules that seek to maximize the higher expected returns of factors like value. If you want to make an especially strong bet on value, probably with a small fraction of your portfolio, using ETFs like QVAL and IVAL is a way to do it. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kldNkfPBCBk&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast) is a great explanation of the firm's ideas by its founder, Wes Gray. BlackRock does have one product like this ([FOVL](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/307330/ishares-focused-value-factor-etf)), although it appears to lack the strong filter for profitability that makes Alpha Architect products highly attractive.

## Example portfolio

These examples are for a hypothetical married couple, both age 35 and earning income, who rent their residence and have no debt. Their combined liquid net worth is $40,000 plus $60,000 in a Roth IRA that one of them has contributed to for several years. In the complex versions, they keep $20,000 in cash and bonds and the remainder in stocks. Stock funds are duplicated because their taxable brokerage account and Roth IRA must be separate. In the couch potato version, they keep about $23,200 in cash and bonds and the remainder in stocks. Only five funds are used, instead of 15 (A) or 14 (B). Importantly for people who prefer simple portfolios, no rebalancing is required in the taxable brokerage account, so they can add new money to the 60/40 allocation fund on a regular basis without having to think about keeping different funds balanced.

The stocks in complex portfolio A are allocated roughly 58.5% US, 30% developed ex-US, and 11.5% emerging. This is very close to global market cap weights. Value is highly overweighted, and small cap value even more so. However, we include nearly all global stocks to some degree by using VT as the core.

The stock allocation is: 40% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) + 17.5% [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 7.5% [RFV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RFV) + 10% [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 10% [AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 7.5% [AVIV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 7.5% [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html). Investment recommendations should be personalized, but if I were to make a recommendation in general for a long-term stock portfolio, it would be something like this. Many people would be well-advised to adjust the allocation to VT upward; few people are suited to a portfolio with less allocation to VT and a stronger value tilt than this. An alternative would be: 60% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) + 11.5% [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 5% [RFV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RFV) + 6.5% [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 7% [AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 5% [AVIV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 5% [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html).

Complex portfolio B has a different approach to achieving factor tilts. It uses RAFI weighting and, to a lesser degree, equal weighting. See the [first footnote](https://github.com/investindex/Funds#f1) for more on this.

#### Additional funds and minor comments

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> The following details are not particularly important except for those people who want to know all their options.

Invesco, the fourth-largest ETF manager, offers many products not available from the behemoths. One category is their equal-weighted funds. They have an equal-weighted small cap fund with the S&P 600 ([EWSC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWSC)), an equal-weighted mid cap fund with the S&P 400 ([EWMC](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EWMC)), and an equal-weighted large cap fund with the S&P 500 ([RSP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RSP)). They also have an equal-weighted Russell 1000 fund ([EQAL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EQAL)), but unlike the other funds it weights equally within sectors, not overall. As Rob Arnott discusses [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZACmAdi7g&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), equal weighting is one way to break the link between a stock's price (i.e., market cap) and its weighting within a fund. (The darts he refers to in the video are not an obscure acronym. They are [actual darts](https://thereformedbroker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jpm_summer2013_rallc.pdf), meaning random selection of equally weighted stocks.) BlackRock has an equal-weighted fund with mid and large cap US stocks ([EUSA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239693/ishares-msci-usa-etf)).

Invesco offers small ([RZV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RZV)), mid ([RFV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RFV)), and large ([RPV](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RPV)) cap US funds with very strong value tilts. Another fund ([SPVU](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPVU)) holds the 100 stocks with the strongest value characteristics in the S&P 500. They also manage three US quality funds ([SPHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=SPHQ) / [XMHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XMHQ) / [XSHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=XSHQ)) and a developed ex-US quality fund ([IDHQ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IDHQ)).

Invesco has a number of RAFI funds: total US ([IUS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IUS)), US small company ([IUSS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=IUSS)), US large company ([PRF](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PRF)), US small and mid company ([PRFZ](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PRFZ)), developed ex-US ([ISDX](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=ISDX)/[PXF](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PXF)), developed ex-US small and mid company ([PDN](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PDN)), and emerging markets ([ISEM](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=ISEM)/[PXH](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PXH)).

Invesco also has a total US fund ([PBUS](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBUS)), a developed ex-North America fund ([PBDM](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBDM)), and an emerging markets fund ([PBEE](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBEE)).

Some Schwab funds don't fit neatly into the summary table: their RAFI total US ETF ([FNDB](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndb)), RAFI US large cap funds ([FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)/[SFLNX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sflnx)), and RAFI emerging markets funds ([FNDE](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fnde)/[SFENX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/sfenx)). And in addition to the Schwab 1000 funds included in the table ([SCHK](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schk)/[SNXFX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/snxfx)), which hold the 1000 largest US companies, Schwab manages a large cap ETF which holds the 750 largest US companies ([SCHX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schx)).

Bond funds that did not fit in the summary table are: BlackRock's US and international high-yield bond fund ([GHYG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239551/ishares-global-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf)); Avantis's aggregate US bond fund ([AVIG](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-core-fixed-income-etf.html)) and short-term bond fund ([AVSF](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-short-term-fixed-income-etf.html)); Invesco's aggregate US bond fund ([PBND](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBND)) and ultrashort-term US treasury bond fund ([CLTL](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=CLTL)). Some of the Vanguard bond ETFs have a mutual fund counterpart with a purchase fee. Those mutual funds are excluded for that reason; other Vanguard bond ETFs lack a mutual fund counterpart. (A purchase fee is distinct from a front-end load: purchase fees are paid to the fund, whereas loads are paid to the broker.)

There are also bond funds in categories not yet discussed. These include mortgage-backed securities, which are included in the aggregate funds like BND ([VMBS](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VMBS) / [MBB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239465/ishares-mbs-etf) / [CMBS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239459/ishares-cmbs-etf) / [SPMB](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-mortgage-backed-bond-etf-spmb)); treasury inflation-protected securities ([TIPS](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/introduction-treasury-inflation-protected-securities-tips/)), which can manage inflation risk ([VTIP](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTIP) / [VIPSX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VIPSX) / [STIP](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239450/ishares-05-year-tips-bond-etf) / [TIP](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239467/ishares-tips-bond-etf) / [SPIP](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-tips-etf-spip) / [SCHP](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schp) / [PBTP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PBTP)); zero-coupon US treasury bonds with long duration, whose market values are highly sensitive to interest rates ([EDV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/EDV) / [GOVZ](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/315911/ishares-25%20-year-treasury-strips-bond-etf-fund)); developed markets ex-US treasury bonds without currency hedging ([IGOV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239830/ishares-international-treasury-bond-etf) / [BWX](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-international-treasury-bond-etf-bwx)); and emerging markets treasury bonds denominated in USD ([VWOB](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VWOB) / [EMB](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239572/ishares-jp-morgan-usd-emerging-markets-bond-etf) / [PCY](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PCY)) or in local currencies ([EBND](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-barclays-emerging-markets-local-bond-etf-ebnd)).

&nbsp;

When deciding on weights for developed vs. emerging markets, keep in mind that all the international single-factor funds that don't have "emerging" in their name invest exclusively in developed countries, except VTRIX.

There are two ETFs for small cap stocks in emerging markets, [EEMS](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239642/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-smallcap-etf) and [EWX](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-emerging-markets-small-cap-etf-ewx). Without a filter for value or profitability, their high expense ratios suggest that these funds are not worth including at this time.

BlackRock has an alternative to IUSV. This fund, [VLUE](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/251616/ishares-msci-usa-value-factor-etf), has a smaller number of holdings and a stronger value tilt than IUSV. It is expected to exaggerate the value premium, so it stands to reason that in the long run VLUE will probably outperform IUSV, with the drawback of higher volatility due to less diversification.

#### Understanding risk factors and why they don't travel alone

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> Before reading this, I recommend listening to Ben Felix’s explanation on [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdREnI5ytc&t=1096s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast) and in [this brief written post](https://rationalreminder.ca/blog/2019/8/22/zqes51gt9xfgi7iggxtjfmuh8z73sf). Hearing it first (from roughly the 18 min to 28 min marks) may help with processing this dense material.

A few concepts must be established to understand why simultaneous implementation of factors is so much more effective than implementation of single factors in separate funds.

The first is that there is information in prices. When people trade a stock — one investor buys and another sells, at a particular price they agree on — they bring their views to the trade about what a fair price is. Most of the dollars involved in trading are from institutional investors.

The next concept is that financial markets are [efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix), which means that prices reflect available information and quickly adapt to new information. The strongest evidence that markets are highly efficient is that [very few](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f1) active managers outperform their benchmark in the long run. The efficiency of the market implies that the information in prices is useful. Markets don’t need to be perfectly efficient — settling upon fair prices for all stocks at every moment — for this information to be valuable.

In particular, we can derive information that is implied about the risk of a stock’s returns. To do so we need to understand _discount rates_, and how we value the ownership provided by shares of a stock. Fractional ownership provides an investor with rights to the company’s assets and future profits. The expected future profits for any company are subject to risk. Investors should be willing to pay less for riskier future profits, and more for safer future profits.

This is where the discount rate comes in: we value future profits less if they are riskier, so we discount them more. In other words, riskier future profits have a higher discount rate applied to them. They also have a higher expected return. This makes sense from the investors’ perspective: in order to be compensated for accepting a higher risk that a given stream of future profits will not materialize, investors must be provided with a higher expected return by paying less for those potential profits. In fact, the discount rate is equivalent to the expected return, because the return generated if the expected profits materialize is equal to the difference between the profits and the discounted price we paid for them.

One more term is needed before we move to the final stage: [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/book-value-basics.asp). There are more details but, simply put, book value describes the assets minus liabilities of a company. It is the most common fundamental measure of a company used to describe relative price: price-to-book (P/B). Stocks with lower prices relative to book value are value stocks; those with higher prices relative to book value are growth stocks.

We’ve established that in an efficient market, stock prices reflect the present value of future profits, discounted at a discount rate which is equal to the expected rate of return. How does this relate to risk factors? Ben Felix discussed a valuation model called the dividend discount model in [this post](https://rationalreminder.ca/blog/2019/8/22/zqes51gt9xfgi7iggxtjfmuh8z73sf). Fully understanding the equation is not really needed to grasp the point of this long chain of conceptual development. What are the core lessons we can draw from it?

The equation describes relationships between a number of variables, including the company's book value, the company's earnings, the stock's market price, and the discount rate/expected return (which are identical). If we hold everything constant except the price and the expected return, what happens when we lower the price? A stock with a lower price than another, all else equal, must have a higher expected return. Why is this? Because we are paying a lower price for the same future profits. In other words, because we assume that the market prices of both stocks are fair, the prices imply that the stock with a lower price is riskier. This is an expression of the value premium, within the equation! The value premium is the empirical finding that stocks with lower prices relative to their book value tend to produce higher returns than those with higher relative prices.

Can we find expressions of the other premiums in this equation? If we hold everything constant except the company's expected future earnings and the expected return, what happens when we increase future earnings? A stock with higher future earnings than another, all else equal, must have higher expected return. The market is observing a stock with higher future earnings than another, and assigning the same price to both. This implies that the market is pricing in higher risk to the stock with higher future earnings. To be clear: the profitability of the first stock is higher, but the price implies that the profits are perceived as riskier. Thus, the counterintuitive statement that stocks with higher profitability are riskier (and have higher expected return) — the profitability premium.

The same follows with the investment premium: all else equal, stocks with more conservative investment in company assets — in jargon, lower expected changes in book equity — must have a higher expected return.

So there is a fantastic insight in this equation: the market price implies a certain discount rate, which we can use to understand the risk and expected return of the stock. We can understand the premiums provided by lower relative price, higher profitability, and more conservative investment from a theoretical perspective. And once we do that, we see the crucial phrase I used repeatedly: all else equal. Ceteris paribus! This is essential because it means that attempting to achieve higher returns by selecting for stocks with low relative prices, or high profitability, or conservative investment is less effective than selecting for stocks with all of those characteristics simultaneously. Filtering for stocks with, say, low relative price without attending to the other factors is not what an understanding of risk factors actually suggests. (I am not implying that funds like RZV and IJS provide no benefit — certainly they provide some exposure to value and profitability, especially RZV.)

This has led to a proliferation of multifactor funds. Unfortunately, I currently have no basis to believe that any of them will achieve consistently high exposure to the academic risk factors. Many institutions are not as concerned with rigorously capturing risk premiums as they are with marketing funds supposedly based on fashionable academic research. The Avantis value funds, which filter for profitability as well as low relative price, are my main recommendations for factor tilts. One example of a specific portfolio using these funds is provided above (complex portfolio A). I have not thoroughly studied all multifactor funds, so for anyone with interest I've listed many of them in the footnote below.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> In general, a multifactor fund should describe how they intend to capture the risk premiums associated with value and profitability (and possibly investment, which appears to be harder to implement). This information would be in their prospectus under "principal investment strategies". The Avantis value funds straightforwardly describe their method of capturing the profitability and value premiums.

In addition, the [factor regression tool](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/factor-analysis) provided by Portfolio Visualizer shows that Avantis funds like AVUV have high exposure to the value and profitability factors, while the multifactor funds below do not. Be aware that the tool is valid only for funds that invest in US stocks. [↩](#fn2)

#### Multifactor funds

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> State Street offers multiple ETFs with a combination of quality, value, and low volatility: [QUS](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-usa-strategicfactorssm-etf-qus), [QEFA](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-eafe-strategicfactorssm-etf-qefa), [QEMM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-emerging-markets-strategicfactorssm-etf-qemm), and [QWLD](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-strategicfactorssm-etf-qwld). Low volatility is advertised because it has strong historical returns, but these returns are explained by [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbJ21WcUWA&ab_channel=BenFelix) [variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002051). Low volatility strategies are an example of failing to efficiently target risk factors.
